# Task-Manager
#Overview

The Task Manager is a web application designed to help users efficiently handle their tasks. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features an engaging, user-friendly interface with a purple-themed design. The application allows users to easily add, edit, delete, and organize tasks. Each task can be customized with a title, description, due date, and priority level, which can be modified as needed. On the main dashboard, tasks are categorized into three sections: Upcoming Tasks, Overdue Tasks, and Completed Tasks, providing a quick overview of task statuses at a glance.

#Setup Instructions:
1>Download the Project Files: Start by downloading the repository.
2>Go to the Project Folder: Open the folder containing the project files.
3>Launch the Application: Right-click on index.html and choose to open it in your preferred browser.
4>Start Using the Task Manager: You’re all set to begin managing tasks!

#Additional Information:
Tasks are stored locally in the browser’s localStorage, allowing data to be retained between sessions. However, this data is unique to the specific browser and device used. Note that clearing your browser’s cache will delete any saved tasks. I followed these steps as instructed.
